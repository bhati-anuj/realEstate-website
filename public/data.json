Generous, light-filled updated kitchen offers recessed lighting, tile floor, granite counters, a butcher block island, abundant cabinets for storage built, and cozy breakfast bar. Utility area off kitchen features laundry hookups, storage, and access to back yard. A private bedroom, offering ceiling fan and mirrored closet with access to full bath would be an ideal private guest suite.

Over 18,000 sqft lot results in sprawling yard with covered patio, and several additional seating areas, covered and uncovered, built-in bbq area, pool, private putting green, decorative pond and fountain, and mature trees and landscaping, resulting in a private oasis and retreat, perfect for recreation or entertaining.  Attached 2-car garage has direct access to the house and additional parking in the wide driveway, including possible RV or Boat parking. Shopping and dining on Ventura Blvd just minutes north. Location, in easy proximity to both the city and the valley, near the Lake Encino preserve, hiking trails, Braemar Country Club, and the Skirball cannot be beat.",

This home has been taken down to the studs, renovated, and completely upgraded for it's new owners.  A modern dark exterior and custom driveway give way to an open floor plan interior. The expansive kitchen includes a massive island, dark stone countertops, and stainless steel appliances.  A large living room and dining area are flooded with natural light from multiple windows and a sliding glass door - which leads out to a large covered patio. Heading down the hallway we find an easy exit to the side yard and two large bedrooms - one of which includes a sliding glass door out to the pool and gorgeous back yard.  The functional layout of this home also includes another exit to the pool at the end of the hall, as well as the entrance to the primary bedroom.  The primary is comprised of two rooms that were combined to create a very large and luxurious bedroom with an oversized sliding glass door looking out on the pool.  Behind a sliding barn door in the primary, we find a walk-in closet and an en suite primary bath.  The backyard is the very definition of luxury, featuring a completely resurfaced pool and waterfall - an entertainer's dream!",

  "description": "1928 English Tudor Cottage is a private oasis within Eagle Rock's highly rated Delevan Elementary School district. Set on a knoll and hidden from the street by a native landscaping and a gated entry. Delight in serene sightlines and views of greenery and rolling hills from most windows. Primary suite easily accommodates a king-sized bed and opens into a third bedroom (currently utilized as a nursery/playroom). Current interior layout configuration would allow new second bathroom without adding to the existing footprint. Living, dining and kitchen have direct access to a rear patio that has hosted countless meals and movie nights with friends and family. The almost 6,000 square foot lot affords a  backyard spacious enough for designated \"zones of entertainment\". Rare to find a home on a hill with a yard this flat. Makes it easier to add an additional structure and still have room to garden and/or play. Additional storage in the attic with high ceilings. Pride of ownership is obvious. This gem of a home has been carefully maintained. Close to a theater (Vidiots), numerous bars and restaurants including Bub & Grandma's, The Capri,  Wife and the Somme, two Targets, a Sprouts access to 2 Freeway.",
